# Mega Generator

This mod requires [technic](https://content.minetest.net/packages/RealBadAngel/technic/) ([github](https://github.com/minetest-mods/technic)).

## What this mod provides

The major function of this mod is so developers or server owners who want to test, develop or provide public machines without the annoyance of needing to build a massive nuclear reactor and all that just to provide/test/develop with technic's machines. Instead they can just install technic and mega_generator and enjoy some fun building cool technic devices.

## Settings

Of course you want to know what can be set and what they mean?

Check out `init.lua` in the `mega_setting` table is comments and settings for default. (Again, all customizable)
